## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compile & hot-reload changes for development

To run a local server for development:

```
yarn run serve
```

### Compile & minify for production

If you want to deploy to a live site for testing, you can generate a build for deployment with:

```

```

Submit pull requests with any changes.  Ensure the changes work locally before making a request: all PRs are tested and anything which does not build correctly will be rejected.
